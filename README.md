# GRAPPA Student Seminar 2019: warm dark matter group

## Topic

Cold dark matter models predict the existence of dark matter halos down to very small masses, much smaller than the smallest dark matter supported galaxies that we actually observe (dwarf spheroidal galaxies). In warm dark matter scenarios these structures would be erased. Why is this the case? What constraints exist on the temperature of dark matter (often expressed in terms of the free-streaming scale, or in terms of the mass of a thermal relic)? How does structure formation proceed throughout the universeâ€™s history with cold versus warm dark matter? What are some motivations for considering warm dark matter?
